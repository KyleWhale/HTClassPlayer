1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,480
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,949
"What is going on inside their head?"

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,704
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

4
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,943
Hmm?

5
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,904
And there she was...

6
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:49,833
Hello.

7
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,801
Riley.

8
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:56,826
Oh, look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

9
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:10,066
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

10
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,263
Whoa.

11
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:35,026
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

12
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,786
Er, for 33 seconds?

13
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,523
I'm Sadness.

14
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,152
Oh, hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

15
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:55,069
Can I just... If you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

16
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,243
And that was just the beginning.

17
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,791
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

18
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,123
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

19
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,843
Whoa, sharp turn!
No! Look out! No!

20
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:10,352
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

21
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:14,193
Easy, easy. Ah!
Oh, we're good. We're good.

22
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,563
- Whew! Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

23
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,083
And we're back!

24
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,426
Oh!

25
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:24,324
Here we go. All right, open.

26
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,044
- Hmm. This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

27
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:27,364
- What is it?
- Aah.

28
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:30,124
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

29
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,284
- Hold on. What is that?
- This is Disgust.

30
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:35,004
She basically keeps Riley
from being poisoned.

31
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,320
Physically and socially.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,524
Hold on, guys.

34
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:40,844
It's broccoli!

35
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,186
Yucky!

36
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,324
Well, I just saved our lives.

37
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:46,604
- Whew!
- Yeah. You're welcome.

38
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,524
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

39
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,964
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

40
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:53,164
That's Anger.

41
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:56,364
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

42
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,284
So that's how you
want to play it, old man?

43
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:01,444
No dessert? Oh, sure,
we'll eat our dinner!

44
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:03,753
Right after you eat this!

45
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:09,587
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

46
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,285
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

47
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,787
- Oh!
- Airplane.

48
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:27,034
And you've met Sadness.
She... Well, she...

49
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,005
I'm not actually sure
what she does.

50
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,325
And I've checked,

51
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:35,685
there's no place for her to go, so...

52
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,506
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

53
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,845
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

54
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:43,045
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

55
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:44,911
Whoo-hoo!

56
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,307
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,950
But the really important ones
are over here.

58
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,526
I don't want to get too technical,

59
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,949
but these are called Core Memories.

60
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,366
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

61
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:00,126
Uh, like when she first scored a goal.

62
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,686
Oh, that was so amazing!

63
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,366
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

64
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,347
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

65
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:19,886
And each Core Memory

66
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,753
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

67
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,116
Like Hockey Island.

68
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,589
Goofball Island is my personal favorite.

69
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:32,109
Ah, come back here, you little monkey!

70
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,927
Oh, you're silly.

71
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,032
Yep, Goofball is the best.

72
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,436
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

73
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,367
Oh, I love Honesty Island.

74
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,709
And that's the truth!

75
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,230
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

76
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,687
The point is,
the Islands of Personality

77
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,047
are what make Riley... Riley!

78
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,595
Look out, mermaid!

79
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,918
Lava! Whee!

80
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,327
♪ Who's your friend who likes to play?

81
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,318
♪ Bing Bong, Bing Bong! ♪

82
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,752
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

83
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,728
Ahhh!

84
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,118
Brain freeze!

85
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,837
Yeah!

86
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,288
Good night, kiddo.

87
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,676
Good night, Dad.

88
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,634
And... we're out!

89
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:42,688
That's what I'm talking about!

90
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,248
Whoo! Another perfect day!

91
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:45,488
Nice job, everybody!

92
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,509
Let's get those memories
down to Long Term.

93
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,248
All right, we did not die today!

94
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,318
I call that an unqualified success.

95
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,489
And that's it. We love our girl.

96
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,753
She's got great friends
and a great house.

97
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,515
Things couldn't be better.

98
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,999
After all, Riley's 11 now.

99
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:22,831
What could happen?

100
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,591
- What...
- Aah!

101
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,353
Okay, not what I had in mind.

102
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,850
Hey, look!
The Golden Gate Bridge!

103
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,050
Isn't that great?

104
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,370
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

105
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,210
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

106
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,890
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

107
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,210
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

108
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,916
Uh, yeah...

109
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,010
Are you kidding?
Get out of the street!

110
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,370
Oh, for Pete's sake! Move it!

111
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,713
These are my kind of people.

112
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,370
All right, just a few more blocks.

113
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,730
We're almost to our new house!

114
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,890
Step on it, Daddy!

115
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,210
Why don't we just live in this smelly car?

116
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,730
We've already been in it forever.

117
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,610
Which, actually, was really lucky,

118
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,290
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

119
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,611
what our new house is going to look like!

120
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:31,159
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

121
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,211
- Ooh! That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

122
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,691
Oh, this will be great for Riley!

123
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,010
Oh, no, no, no, no, this one!

124
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:38,131
Oh, Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

125
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,440
That's the one!
It comes with a dragon.

126
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,792
Now we're getting close,
I can feel it.

127
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,075
Here it is, here's our new house.

128
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,593
And...

129
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,675
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

130
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,931
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

131
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:05,971
I'm telling you,
it smells like something died in here.

132
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,131
Can you die from moving?

133
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,651
Guys, you're overreacting.

134
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,091
Nobody is dying...

135
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,212
A dead mouse!

136
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,092
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

137
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,612
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

138
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,172
Get off of me!

139
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:17,532
Hey. All through the drive,

140
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:19,492
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

141
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:20,652
Let's go check it out!

142
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:21,772
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

143
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,114
Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:24,172
No, no, no, no, no.

145
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,532
I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

146
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,612
Get out the rubber ball,

147
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:28,012
we're in solitary confinement.

148
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,092
Riley can't live here.

149
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:30,172
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

150
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:31,652
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

151
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,292
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

152
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,972
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

153
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,252
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

154
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:40,772
- Where did you read that?
- It doesn't matter.

155
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:41,812
I read it and it's great.

156
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:42,972
We'll put the bed there.

157
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,132
And the desk over there.

158
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,452
The hockey lamp goes there.

159
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,492
Uh, put the chair there.

160
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:48,052
The trophy collection goes there.

161
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,732
Stars! I like that!

162
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:50,972
Now we're talking!

163
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,993
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

164
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,653
All right. Goodbye.

165
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:55,733
Well, guess what?

166
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,493
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

167
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,013
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-hmm.

168
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:01,373
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

169
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,213
That figures. The van is lost.

170
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,573
You said it would be here yesterday!

171
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,973
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

172
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,213
Mom and Dad are stressed out!

173
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,053
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

174
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,874
I've got a great idea!

175
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,493
Did you even read the contract?

176
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,933
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

177
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:18,013
Hey!

178
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,133
Oh, no, you're not!

179
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:20,253
She's lining up for the shot!

180
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:21,333
Coming behind you.

181
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,213
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores!

182
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,124
Yeah!

183
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,173
- Come on, Grandma!
- Ha!

184
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,213
"Grandma"?

185
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,318
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

186
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,693
Whoo!

187
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,843
Hey, put me down!

188
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,614
Ah! Sorry.

189
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,002
Hold on. Hold on.

190
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,694
- Hello?
- Wait. Wh...

191
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,161
You're kidding.

192
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:47,374
All right. Stall for me.

193
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,716
I'll be right there.

194
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,414
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

195
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:51,694
not today!

196
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,214
I got to go.

197
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,694
It's okay. We get it.

198
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,241
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

199
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,195
See you, sweetie.

200
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:00,374
Dad just left us.

201
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:02,054
He doesn't love us anymore.

202
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,374
That's sad.

203
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,205
I should drive, right?

204
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,762
Joy?

205
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,374
What are you doing?

206
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,174
Uh, just give me one second.

207
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,294
Um, you know what I've realized?

208
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,876
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

209
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:19,654
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

210
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:20,814
Maybe we could try that?

211
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,255
Pizza sounds delicious.

212
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,166
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

213
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,815
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

214
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,095
That's it. I'm done.

215
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:32,255
Congratulations, San Francisco,

216
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:33,455
you've ruined pizza!

217
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:34,975
First the Hawaiians

218
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,317
and now you!

219
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,763
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

220
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:42,199
Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

221
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,295
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

222
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,415
- At that diner in Nebraska.
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,815
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

224
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,135
That was disgusting.

225
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,735
Oh, good. Family is running.

226
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,095
Dad's got a steel stomach.

227
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,855
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

228
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,255
What was your favorite part?

229
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,735
Spitting out the car window!

230
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,255
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

231
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:00,455
Wearing a seat belt!

232
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,436
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

233
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,436
- Oh, that's the one.
- Definitely!

234
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,736
Say cheese!

235
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,296
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

236
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:08,957
- Now hold still.
- The car!

237
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,246
Stop! No, no, no!

238
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,096
Nice one, Joy.

239
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:15,656
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

240
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,601
That was pretty funny.

241
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,402
Wait. What? What happened?

242
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,637
She did something
to the memory.

243
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,816
- What did you do?
- I just touched it.

244
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,776
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

245
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:36,136
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

246
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:38,136
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

247
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,856
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

248
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:41,336
she's gonna feel sad.

249
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,856
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, Joy.

250
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,216
I don't really know...

251
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:46,002
I thought maybe if you...

252
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:49,681
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

253
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,097
Just don't touch any other memories

254
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,657
until we figure out what's going on.

255
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:55,977
- Okay.
- All right.

256
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,137
Get ready. This is a monster railing

257
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,401
and we are riding it all the way down!

258
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,518
Wait, what? What happened?

259
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:11,537
A Core Memory!

260
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,879
Oh, no!

261
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:16,897
Sadness, what are you doing?

262
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,017
It looked like
one was crooked

263
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,017
so I opened it and then it fell out.

264
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,359
I...

265
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:26,559
Whoo-hoo!

266
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:29,777
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

267
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,530
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa!

268
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,658
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

269
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,058
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

270
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:39,298
I know. I'm sorry.

271
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:41,178
Something's wrong with me.

272
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,178
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

273
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:45,338
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

274
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:48,138
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

275
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,378
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

276
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,378
You know what?

277
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,378
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

278
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,138
There's always a way to
turn things around,

279
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:57,778
to find the fun.

280
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,803
Yeah. Find the fun.

281
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,378
I don't know how to do that.

282
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:02,778
Okay. Well,

283
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:04,609
try to think of something funny.

284
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:05,738
Um... Oh!

285
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,538
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

286
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:10,658
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

287
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,418
What about that time with Meg

288
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,338
when Riley laughed so hard

289
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,728
milk came out of her nose?

290
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,339
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

291
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,019
Ooh, it was awful.

292
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,779
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

293
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,579
Uh, what are your favorite things to do?

294
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:27,899
My favorite?

295
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,379
Um... Well, I like it when we're outside.

296
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,379
That's good. Like there's
the beach and sunshine.

297
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,819
Oh! Like that time

298
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,619
we buried Dad
in the sand up to his neck.

299
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,167
I was thinking more like rain.

300
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,539
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

301
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,459
We can stomp around in puddles.

302
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:48,739
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

303
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,819
More like when
the rain runs down our back

304
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,650
and makes our shoes soggy.

305
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,779
And we get all cold, shivery, and

306
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:58,660
everything just starts
feeling droopy.

307
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,129
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, easy.

308
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,761
Why are you crying?

309
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,326
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

310
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,780
Crying helps me slow down and obsess

311
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,203
over the weight of life's problems.

312
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,660
You know what? Let's, uh,

313
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,020
think about something else.

314
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,860
How about we read
some mind manuals, huh?

315
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,140
- Sounds fun.
- I've read most of them.

316
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,140
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

317
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,340
"Long Term Memory Retrieval,
Volume 47"?

318
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,888
- No.
- Ooh, a real page-turner!

319
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,820
"Long Term Memory data selection

320
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,580
"via channel subgrouping"?

321
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,180
See? Fun already! Oh, you lucky dog.

322
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,580
You're reading these cool things.

323
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,162
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

324
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,941
What can we do?
We've only got capital

325
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,772
to last a month, maybe two.

326
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,541
If we can't find investors by then,

327
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,402
we're going to have to lay people off.

328
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,261
Mom! Dad!

329
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,741
Come kiss me good night!

330
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,141
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

331
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,211
We've got to land this, okay?

332
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:06,044
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

333
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,021
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

334
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,621
There are no bears in San Francisco.

335
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,781
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

336
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,141
Oh, I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

337
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,541
Ew! I don't want to
hear about your nerves.

338
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:21,421
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

339
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:23,021
That's what I've been
telling you guys!

340
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,502
There are at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

341
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,222
The smell alone is
enough to make her gag.

342
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,222
I can't believe
Mom and Dad moved us here!

343
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:31,662
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

344
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,062
But we've been through worse!

345
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,902
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

346
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,893
Riley should be happy about.

347
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,702
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

348
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,702
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

349
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,542
And all of our stuff is in the missing van!

350
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,302
Oh, come on. It could be worse.

351
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:48,533
Yeah, Joy. We could be
lying on the dirty floor. In a bag.

352
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,942
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.

353
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:52,542
But think of all the good things that...

354
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,942
No, Joy. There's
absolutely no reason for Riley

355
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:56,382
to be happy right now.

356
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,502
Let us handle this.

357
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,742
I say we skip school tomorrow

358
00:16:58,782 --> 00:16:59,982
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

359
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,782
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

360
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,502
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

361
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,301
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

362
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,292
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

363
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,183
Look, we all have our off days.

364
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:12,343
- You know...
- Hi, honey.

365
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:15,143
The Mom bad news train is pulling in.

366
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,463
Toot-toot!

367
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,423
Still no moving van.

368
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:21,063
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

369
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,223
Toot-toot-toot!

370
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,292
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

371
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,463
This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

372
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,063
I rest my case!

373
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,823
Oh, your dad's a little stressed,

374
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,903
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

375
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:34,690
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

376
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:39,612
I guess all I really
want to say is, thank you.

377
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:40,943
- Huh?
- You know,

378
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:44,143
through all this confusion
you've stayed...

379
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,486
Well,
you've stayed our happy girl.

380
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:49,404
Your dad's
under a lot of pressure,

381
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,984
but if you and I can keep smiling,

382
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,656
it would be a big help.

383
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,333
We can do that for him. Right?

384
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:58,606
Whoa.

385
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:00,726
Well.

386
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,491
Yeah, sure.

387
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,730
What did we do to deserve you?

388
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,525
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

389
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,824
Well, you can't argue with Mom.
Happy it is.

390
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:16,264
Team Happy! Sounds great!

391
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,686
Totally behind you, Joy.

392
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,824
Looks like we're going into REM.

393
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:22,344
I got Dream Duty, so I'll take care

394
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:23,824
of sending these to Long Term.

395
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,544
Great day today, guys!

396
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,965
Oh, sleep well, Team Happy!

397
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,693
All right,
what's on tonight, Dream Production?

398
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:39,375
Well, this is it. The new place.

399
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:45,333
Come live with me, Riley.

400
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,625
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

401
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,331
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

402
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:54,065
No! Who is in charge
of programming down there?

403
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:56,374
I know I'm not supposed to do this, but...

404
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:03,575
We are not going to
end the day like this.

405
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:48,813
Don't you worry.

406
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:52,768
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

407
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,778
I promise.

408
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,947
Hello! Did I wake you?

409
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:11,267
- Do you have to play that?
- Well, I have to practice.

410
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:14,293
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

411
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,627
Okay, first day of school!

412
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,747
Very, very exciting.

413
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,947
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

414
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,387
Here it is! Fear.

415
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,947
I need a list of all the possible

416
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:25,147
negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

417
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,307
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

418
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:29,507
Disgust. Make sure
Riley stands out today.

419
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:30,787
But also blends in.

420
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,707
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

421
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:34,947
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

422
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:36,027
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

423
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,507
"You'll be in charge of the console,

424
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:38,987
"keeping Riley happy all day long.

425
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,747
"And may I add I love
your dress? It's adorable."

426
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,267
"Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much.

427
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,467
"I love the way it twirls."

428
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:46,415
Train of Thought! Right on schedule.

429
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,348
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

430
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:52,708
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

431
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,788
It might come in handy.
If this new school is full of

432
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:57,708
boring, useless classes.
Which it probably will be.

433
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:01,548
Oh. Sadness. I have
a super important job just for you.

434
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:03,653
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm. Follow me.

435
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:08,308
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

436
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,428
This is the circle of Sadness.

437
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,228
Your job is to make sure that

438
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:15,015
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

439
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,708
So you want me to just stand here?

440
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:20,668
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

441
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,148
Just make sure that all the Sadness

442
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:25,508
stays in the circle!

443
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:28,709
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

444
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:29,869
- No.
- Atta girl.

445
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,189
All right, everyone, fresh start.

446
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,429
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

447
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:34,629
which will turn into a good year,

448
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,989
which turns into a good life!

449
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:39,189
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

450
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:41,509
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

451
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,189
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

452
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:44,861
Very cute!

453
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,549
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

454
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:49,189
Mom and Dad? With us in public?
No thank you.

455
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:50,269
Uh... I'm on it!

456
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,629
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

457
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,330
Have a good day at school, monkey.

458
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,260
Have a great day, sweetheart!

459
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,189
That's crazy. It really is.

460
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,570
That was so funny.

461
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,570
Do you know
what basketball game is coming up?

462
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:09,189
Are you sure we want to do this?

463
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,501
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

464
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,830
Did you see her? Hello!

465
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,790
Okay, we've got
a group of cool girls at two o'clock.

466
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,230
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced,

467
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,390
infinity scarf.

468
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,750
Whoa. Is she
wearing eye shadow?

469
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,830
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

470
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,670
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

471
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,030
We want them to like us.

472
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,470
Oh. Yeah. Wait, what?

473
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,390
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

474
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,670
Worst scenario is either quicksand,

475
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,190
spontaneous combustion,

476
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,990
or getting called on by the teacher.

477
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,310
So as long as none of those happen...

478
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,030
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

479
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,110
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?

480
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,430
This is not happening!

481
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,190
Riley, would you like
to tell us something about yourself?

482
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,430
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

483
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,977
Don't worry. I got this.

484
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,581
Uh... Okay.

485
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,431
My name is Riley Andersen.

486
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,981
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

487
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,311
And how about Minnesota?

488
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,671
Can you tell us something about it?

489
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,253
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

490
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,222
She's hilarious!

491
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:15,151
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

492
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,271
The lake freezes over,

493
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,711
and that's when we play hockey.

494
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,111
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie Dogs.

495
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:23,058
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

496
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,974
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

497
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,431
It's kind of a family tradition.

498
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,536
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

499
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:35,071
Or we did, till I moved away.

500
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,551
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

501
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:40,152
Hey, Sadness! You touched
a memory? We talked about this.

502
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,992
Oh, yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

503
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:45,152
Get back in your circle.
What's going on?

504
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,192
- Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

505
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:49,672
We used
to play tag and stuff.

506
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,472
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

507
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:52,552
- Did you see that look?
- Oh, no.

508
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:53,894
They're judging us!

509
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:57,700
Somebody help me!
Grab that... Everybody put...

510
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,181
But everything's different now.

511
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:02,060
Since we moved.

512
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:07,832
Oh, no! We're crying! At school!

513
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:10,460
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

514
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:13,734
Oh, no! Oh, I'm sorry!

515
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,952
Huh?

516
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,872
It's a Core Memory!

517
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,624
But it's blue.

518
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,856
No! Wait! Stop it! No! Ah! No!

519
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:31,993
Joy, no.

520
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:33,513
- That's a Core Memory!
- Hey!

521
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:35,060
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

522
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:37,384
Ah! The Core Memories!

523
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,455
No, no, no, no!

524
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,976
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

525
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:07,914
Thank you, Riley.

526
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:10,434
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

527
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,539
but we're happy to have you here.

528
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:15,074
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

529
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,985
and turn to chapter seven.

530
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,299
Can I say that curse word now?

531
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:41,137
Ah!

532
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:45,658
Oh, no! One, two, three. Okay.

533
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:50,139
I got them. Where are we?

534
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:53,537
Long Term Memory? Wait...

535
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,661
Goofball Island?

536
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,635
Riley's Islands of Personality.

537
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,501
They're all down!

538
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,995
Oh! This is bad.

539
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,338
We... We can fix this!

540
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,555
We just have to
get back to Headquarters,

541
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:15,075
plug the Core Memories in,

542
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,100
and Riley will be back to normal.

543
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,235
Riley has no Core Memories.

544
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:22,658
No Personality Islands and no...

545
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:24,835
What? What is it?

546
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,995
You.

547
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,875
You're not in Headquarters.

548
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,867
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

549
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:33,141
We got to get you back up there.

550
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,143
I'm coming, Riley.

551
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,276
So, as it turns out, the green trash can

552
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:53,356
is not recycling, it's for greens.

553
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:55,076
- Like compost. And eggshells.
- Mmm.

554
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,836
And the blue one is recycling.

555
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,796
- And the black one is trash.
- Riley is acting so weird.

556
00:26:58,836 --> 00:26:59,916
Why is she acting so weird?

557
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:02,316
What do you expect?
All the Islands are down.

558
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:03,476
Joy would know what to do.

559
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:04,756
That's it.

560
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:07,596
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

561
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:10,556
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,

562
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,228
how are we supposed to be happy?

563
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,556
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

564
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:17,477
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

565
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:19,557
And get this: Try-outs are tomorrow

566
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,557
after school. What luck, right?

567
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,957
- Hockey?
- Uh-oh. What do we do?

568
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:24,597
Guys, this is...

569
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:25,837
You pretend to be Joy.

570
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,067
Won't it be great to be
back out on the ice?

571
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:32,299
Oh, yeah, that sounds fantastic.

572
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,917
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

573
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,420
- Uh, because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

574
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:40,757
Did you guys pick up on that?

575
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,557
- Mmm-hmm. Something's wrong.
- Totally.

576
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:43,917
Should we ask her?

577
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:45,717
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,

578
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,077
so she doesn't notice.

579
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:49,277
So, how was the first day of school?

580
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,397
She's probing us.

581
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,797
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

582
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,505
What? Okay. Um, hmm.

583
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:57,717
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

584
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,718
Oh. Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

585
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,638
Something is definitely going on.

586
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,380
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

587
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:06,758
We're going to
find out what's happening.

588
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,118
But we'll need support.

589
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:09,460
Signal the husband.

590
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,506
Ahem!

591
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:15,118
With a nice
pass over to Reeves,

592
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,620
comes across ...and nice!

593
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,478
Uh-oh. She's looking at us.
Uh, what did she say?

594
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:26,118
What? Oh! Sorry, sir.
No one was listening.

595
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,278
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

596
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,318
What? What is it, woman? What?

597
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:32,478
Ugh, he's making that stupid face again.

598
00:28:32,518 --> 00:28:34,478
I could strangle him right now.

599
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:35,866
Signal him again.

600
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:41,078
Ah! So, Riley, how was school?

601
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,039
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

602
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,224
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

603
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,185
Move! I'll be Joy.

604
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,359
School was great, all right?

605
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,479
Riley. Is everything okay?

606
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,759
Ugh!

607
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,599
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

608
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,079
What is her deal?

609
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,839
All right, make a show of force.

610
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,399
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

611
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,519
No, not the foot!

612
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

613
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,479
Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man.

614
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,185
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

615
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,839
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

616
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,909
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

617
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,639
Take it to DEFCON Two.

618
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,028
You heard that, gentlemen.
DEFCON Two.

619
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,519
Listen, young lady, I don't know where

620
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,639
this disrespectful attitude came from...

621
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,239
You want a piece of this, pops?

622
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,559
Come and get it!

623
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,240
Yeah, well... Well...

624
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,709
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

625
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,712
Keys to safety position.

626
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,141
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

627
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,426
Just shut up!

628
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,707
Fire!

629
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,520
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

630
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,862
Uh!

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,907
The foot is down! The foot is down!

632
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,760
Good job, gentlemen.

633
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,626
That could have been a disaster.

634
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,906
Well, that was a disaster.

635
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,191
Come fly with me, gatinha.

636
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:20,028
We're going to walk out there? On that?

637
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:21,841
It's the quickest way back.

638
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:23,921
But it's right over the Memory Dump.

639
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:26,401
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

640
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:30,241
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

641
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,761
- Oh, okay.
- It's not that high.

642
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:34,025
It's totally fine...

643
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,543
No!

644
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,343
Hey.

645
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:55,267
So, uh, things got a little
out of hand downstairs.

646
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:57,634
Do you want to talk about it?

647
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:01,390
Come on, where's my happy girl?

648
00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:04,952
Monkey.

649
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:07,226
Oh, he's trying to start up Goofball.

650
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:09,304
Come on!

651
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:20,984
Ah!

652
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,468
Go back! Run, run, run!

653
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:52,745
What...

654
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,035
I get it. You need some alone time.

655
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,190
We'll talk later.

656
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,204
We have a major problem.

657
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:22,468
Oh, Joy, where are you?

658
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:25,913
We lost Goofball Island.

659
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,884
That means she can lose Friendship

660
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:30,387
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

661
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:33,269
You can fix this, right, Joy?

662
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:36,484
I, uh... I don't know.

663
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,364
- Oh...
- But we have to try.

664
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:39,786
Okay, come on.

665
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:42,844
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Oh...

666
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,484
Which is a good thing.

667
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:46,804
When you think about it because

668
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,964
nothing else bad
can happen while she's asleep.

669
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:51,204
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

670
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:53,912
We'll just go across Friendship Island.

671
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:57,444
Oh, we'll never make it.

672
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:58,724
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no!

673
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:00,324
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

674
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:02,364
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

675
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:04,965
Oh, Sadness,
we don't have time for this.

676
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:08,469
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

677
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:11,245
Wait, Joy,
you could get lost in there!

678
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:12,805
Think positive!

679
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:16,468
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

680
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:18,790
That's Long Term Memory.

681
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,245
An endless warren
of corridors and shelves.

682
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:23,156
I read about it in the manuals.

683
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,565
The manuals?

684
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:26,725
The manuals!

685
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:28,605
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

686
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:30,914
So you know
the way back to Headquarters!

687
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:32,205
I guess.

688
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:34,355
Ooh!

689
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,365
You are my map!

690
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,685
Let's go! Lead on, my map!

691
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,845
Show me where we're going!

692
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:43,685
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

693
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:46,646
Just give me a few... hours.

694
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:48,034
Ooh!

695
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:49,646
Which way? Left?

696
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,068
Right.

697
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,486
No. I mean, go left.

698
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:54,446
I said left was right. Like "correct."

699
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:55,806
Okay.

700
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:58,036
This actually
feels kind of nice.

701
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,726
Okay, here we go!

702
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:01,926
We'll be back to Headquarters
before morning.

703
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:05,714
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

704
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:11,485
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

705
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,317
Yeah, just another right.

706
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:18,326
And... a left and then another... left and...

707
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:21,005
Uh, are you sure
you know where we're going?

708
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:24,078
Because we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

709
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:26,966
Riley's awake.

710
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,467
Ooh! Oh!

711
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,167
Don't touch. Remember?

712
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,806
If you touch them, they stay sad.

713
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:38,246
Oh, sorry, I won't. Starting now.

714
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,687
Oh, I can't take much more of this.

715
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:42,167
Forget them!

716
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,286
Mind workers!

717
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:44,754
But, Joy, we're almost...

718
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,167
Phone numbers.

719
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:48,806
We don't need all these.
They're in her phone.

720
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:51,588
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

721
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,047
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this.

722
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,847
Four years of piano lessons.

723
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:56,967
Yeah,
it looks pretty faded.

724
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,487
You know what'? Save Chopsticks

725
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:00,428
and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

726
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,047
- Are you...
- US Presidents. What do you think?

727
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,207
Yeah, just keep
Washington, Lincoln and the fat one.

728
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:05,487
- Forget 'em!
- Hey!

729
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:06,687
You can't throw those away!

730
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:08,007
Those are perfectly good memories.

731
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,367
The names of
every "Cutie Pie Princess" doll?

732
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,207
Yes! That is critical information!

733
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:13,568
Glitterstorm, Honeypants...

734
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:14,956
Forget 'em!

735
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:20,968
Hey! Bring those back!

736
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:23,208
They're in the dump. Nothing
comes back from the dump.

737
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,768
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

738
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:27,088
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

739
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,768
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

740
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:32,591
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

tell me which way is...

Oh, no!

780
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,675
Oh, not Friendship.

781
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,075
Oh, Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

782
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,516
Goodbye, friendship.
Hello, loneliness.

783
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,312
We'll just have to go the long way.

784
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,360
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

785
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,673

00:37:34,091 --> 00:37:35,771
Ooh! Look at you!

788
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,011
Huh?

789
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,691
I will take you, but not you.

790
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,034
Oh, who am I kidding?
I can't leave you.

791
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,971
Hello!

792
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,473
Wait! Hey! Wait!

793
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:49,033
Oh, wait! Stop!

794
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:59,118
- Excuse me.
- Ah!

Uh, I was looking for, um... Diversion!

Wait. I know you.

799
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:12,452
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

800
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,212
No, no, no. I do.

- Well, of course!

803
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:22,052
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

804
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,572
Oh! Oh, you would know.

805

Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

808
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,892
- You're Joy? The Joy?
- Mmm-hmm.

809
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:33,532
What the heck are you doing out here?

810
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,732
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

811
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,852
Wow. Without you,
Riley won't ever be happy.

812
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,252
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,332

Hey, hey. Don't be sad.

00:39:42,974 --> 00:39:45,094
Tell you what. When I get
back up to Headquarters,

Oh, are you okay?

Hey, what's going on?

851
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:01,574

Ooh. Whoa!

Ooh, here, use this.

855
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:08,675
- Thanks!
- Whoa, hold on, wait a second.

856
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:14,159
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

857
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:19,680
Here. What? It's imaginary.

858
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,655
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier

859
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:22,815
to walk back to Headquarters.

860
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,615
Walk? We're not walking.

861
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,004
We're taking the Train of Thought!

862
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:30,215
The train, of course!

863
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:32,895
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

864
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:34,695
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

865
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,716
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

866
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,957
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

867
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,478
Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

868
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:45,495
The station is right
through here. After you.

869
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:46,815
- Joy.
- What?

870
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,535
I read about this place

871
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,295
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

872
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:52,335
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

873
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,495
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

874
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,695
What are you talking about?

875
00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:58,615
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

876
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:02,564
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

877
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,456
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

878
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:08,561
because I'm taking the shortcut.

879
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:10,696
Let's go around. This way.

880
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,607
Almost there!

881
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:15,776
If you want to walk the
long way, go for it.

882
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,896
But Riley needs to be happy.

883
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,496
I'm not missing that train.

884
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:20,896
Bing Bong knows what he's doing.

885
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,936
He's part dolphin.
They're very smart.

886
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,927
Well, I guess.

887
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,720
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

888
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,217
Okay, what abstract concept

889
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:46,577
are we trying to comprehend today?

890
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,537
Um... Loneliness.

891
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:50,577
Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.

892
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:51,817
I'm going to turn it on for a minute

893
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:53,177
and burn out the gunk.

894
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:55,817
What did I tell you?
You'll be at Headquarters in no time.

895
00:41:55,857 --> 00:41:57,097
Whoa!

896
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,657
Say,
would you look at that?

897
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,697
Whoa! What's happening?

898
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:02,097
Oh, no, they turned it on.

899
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:04,440
Huh. Never seen this before.

900
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,457
My face! My beautiful face! Oh!

901
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:12,097
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

902
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:14,297
There are four stages. This is the first:

903
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:16,137
Non-objective Fragmentation!

904
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,297
All right. Do not panic.

905
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:20,721
What is important is that
we all stay together. Oh!

906
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:23,977
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

907
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:26,400
Run! Ah!

908
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:28,609
I can't feel my legs!

909
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:30,218
Oh, there they are.

910
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:31,640
Come here, me!

911
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:34,698
We've got to get out of here

912
00:42:34,738 --> 00:42:36,458
before we're nothing
but shape and color!

913
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:38,858
Ow! We'll get stuck here forever!

914
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:40,578
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

915
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:42,938
I told you, it's a shortcut!

916
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,407
The train!

917
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:52,178
Oh, no. We're
two-dimensional! That's stage three!

918
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:53,520
We're getting nowhere!

919
00:42:53,578 --> 00:42:56,200
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

920
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:01,085
We can't fit.

921
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:03,178
Oh, no, we're Nonfigurative.

922
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:04,858
This is the last stage!

923
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:06,719
We're not going to make it!

924
00:43:08,658 --> 00:43:12,123
Wait! We're
two-dimensional. Fall on your face!

925
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:25,044
Stop! Stop!

926
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,379
Oh, no! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

927
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:32,379
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

928
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:34,419
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

929
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:35,819
How long until the next train?

930
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:37,899
Who knows. But don't worry.

931
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:39,539
There's another station. That way.

932
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:41,059
The train always stops there.

933
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:42,699
Right before it goes to Headquarters.

934
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:44,739
If we hurry, we can catch it.

935
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:46,899
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

936
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,049
Yeah!

937
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,059
Is there really another station?

938
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,686
Uh-huh. Through there.

939
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,460
Welcome to Imagination Land!

940
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,580
Imagination Land?

941
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,740
Sure!

942
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,100
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

943
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,980
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French Fry Forest!

944
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,164
- Mmm! Delicious.
- No way!

945
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Check it out!
Trophy Town!

946
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,411
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

947
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,300
I won first place!

948
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,740
- Me too!
- Oh, participation award.

949
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,580
Wait, is that... Sadness,
look, it's Cloud Town!

950
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,340
That is my favorite!

951
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,620
Oh, it's so soft!

952
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,260
Oh! Let me try.

953
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,260
Hey! What's the big idea?

954
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,047
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

955
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,021
Oh, no! Lava! Whoo! Oh!

956
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:39,251
Imagination Land is the best!

957
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:43,101
Oh, is it all going to be so interactive?

958
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,341
Hey, look! The House of Cards!

959
00:44:45,381 --> 00:44:47,332
Oh, wait. Hang on just a minute.

960
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,381
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

961
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,141
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

962
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,928
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

963
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,527
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Great.

964
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,861
Oh, I love Imagination Land.

965
00:44:58,901 --> 00:45:01,489
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

966
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:05,581
Who the heck is that?

967
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:07,021
Imaginary boyfriend.

968
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:08,701
I would die for Riley.

969
00:45:08,741 --> 00:45:10,901
Oh, I've never seen him before.

970
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,482
I live in Canada.

971
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:15,061
Anyway, this way.
Through Preschool World!

972
00:45:15,101 --> 00:45:16,421
We're nearly to the train!

973
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:17,962
Riley, here we come! Whoo-hoo!

974
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:24,046
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

975
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:25,582
These kids look pretty good,

976
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,222
considering they're from San Francisco.

977
00:45:27,262 --> 00:45:28,582
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

978
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,222
- Got to go.
- Okay.

979
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:31,622
Good luck, sweetie!

980
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,822
Luck isn't going to help us now.

981
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:34,702
If she tries to use Hockey Island,
it's going down.

982
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:36,462
Which is why I've recalled

983
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,342
every hockey memory I can think of.

984
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,582
One of these has got to work

985
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:41,102
in place of the Core Memory.

986
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:42,774
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

987
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:52,813
Ha-ha! We did it, gang! It's working!

988
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:54,164
Oh!

989
00:45:55,942 --> 00:45:57,622
Line change! Line change!

990
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:59,772
Change it up!

991
00:46:04,423 --> 00:46:06,647
No! No! Aah!

992
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:13,383
It's like
we don't learn anything.

993
00:46:13,423 --> 00:46:15,423
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

994
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:17,143
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

995
00:46:17,183 --> 00:46:18,531
Oh!

996
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:22,023
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

997
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:23,889
Find your happy place.

998
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:29,252
What's her problem?

999
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:37,583
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

1000
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,023
You're not going to finish tryouts?

1001
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,423
- What's the point?
- Hey.

1002
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,583
It'll be all right. Let's just go back...

1003
00:46:42,623 --> 00:46:44,813
Stop saying everything will be all right!

1004
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:48,649
Nice hustle, ladies!

1005
00:46:56,304 --> 00:46:57,652
Hockey?

1006
00:47:00,504 --> 00:47:04,969
Oh, no, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

1007
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,144
Hey! Look at that!

1008
00:47:06,184 --> 00:47:07,424
- Very nice shot!
- Hey!

1009
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:09,184
Bing Bong, we have to
get to that station.

1010
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:10,304
Sure thing. This way,

1011
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:12,295
just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey.

1012
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:13,424
That's weird.

1013
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,944
Graham Cracker Castle
used to be right here.

1014
00:47:14,984 --> 00:47:17,384
I wonder why
they moved it? Wow, that's not...

1015
00:47:17,424 --> 00:47:19,904
I would have sworn
Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here.

1016
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:21,624
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

1017
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,246
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess Dream World!

1018
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:29,096
Oh, no! The stuffed
Animal Hall of Fame!

1019
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,132
My rocket!

1020
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:34,745
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

1021
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,385
It still has some song power left!

1022
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:39,326
♪ Who's your friend who likes to play? ♪

1023
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:49,065
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

1024
00:47:49,105 --> 00:47:50,896
Riley and I are going to the moon!

1025
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:53,487
Oh!

1026
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:58,768
Riley can't be done with me.

1027
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:08,345
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

1028
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,265
We just need to
get back to Headquarters.

1029
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,745
Which way to the train station?

1030
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:14,328
I had a whole trip planned for us.

1031
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:17,746
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?

1032
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:20,169
Here comes the tickle monster!

1033
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,167
Hey, Bing Bong! Look at this!

1034
00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:27,266
Oh! Here's a fun game!

1035
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:31,426
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

1036
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:34,896
Won't that be fun? Come on,
let's go to the train station!

1037
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,496
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

1038
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:41,376
They took something that you loved.

1039
00:48:41,946 --> 00:48:43,826
It's gone. Forever.

1040
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:45,946
Sadness. Don't make him feel worse.

1041
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:47,066
Sorry.

1042
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:49,057
It's all I had left of Riley.

1043
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:52,293
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

1044
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,426
Oh, they were wonderful.

1045
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:56,186
Once we flew back in time.

1046
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,227
We had breakfast twice that day.

1047
00:48:58,267 --> 00:48:59,387
Sadness...

1048
00:48:59,427 --> 00:49:02,095
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

1049
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:06,130
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

1050
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:09,057
Yeah. It's sad.

1051
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:15,889
Wh...

1052
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:22,889
I'm okay now.

1053
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:27,492
Come on. The train station is this way.

1054
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,067
How did you do that?

1055
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:37,307
Oh, I don't know. He was sad.

1056
00:49:37,347 --> 00:49:38,587
So I listened to what...

1057
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,737
Hey! There's the train!

1058
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,450
Oh! We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

1059
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:59,788
Oh, no! These Facts and Opinions
look so similar.

1060
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:02,291
Oh, don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

1061
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:07,948
On a scale of one to ten,

1062
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:09,468
I give this day an F.

1063
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:12,388
Well, why don't we quit standing
around and do something?

1064
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:13,508
Like what, genius?

1065
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:15,708
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

1066
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,588
Sure it's the coward's way out.

1067
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:19,897
But this coward's gonna survive.

1068
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:23,090
Ow!

1069
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:29,415
Emotions can't quit, genius!

1070
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:33,301
Ugh! I thought we were supposed to
be keeping Riley happy.

1071
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:35,455
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1072
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:37,776
Mmm.

1073
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,813
Aha!

1074
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:42,650
- What is it?
- Oh, nothing.

1075
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,012
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

1076
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:46,429
All the good Core Memories

1077
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:47,749
were made in Minnesota.

1078
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:50,869
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

1079
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:52,109
- Ta-da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1080
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,149
You're saying we run away?

1081
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:55,509
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

1082
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:58,269
I'd call it the Happy Core
Memory Development program.

1083
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:59,509
You can't be serious.

1084
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:00,989
Hey! Our life was perfect

1085
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:03,389
until Mom and Dad decided to move to

1086
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:05,109
San Fran Stinktown.

1087
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,349
I mean,
it's just so drastic!

1088
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:09,670
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

1089
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,390
Our room? Our back yard?

1090
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,732
Our friends?

1091
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,870
♪ TripleDent gum
♪ Will make you smile ♪

1092
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,190
Did I ask for the gum commercial?

1093
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,870
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

1094
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,390
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

1095
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,830
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

1096
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,430
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

1097
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,470
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

1098
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,700
are just around the corner.

1099
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,218
Huh?

1100
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,510
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

1101
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,058
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

1102
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,790
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

1103
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,751
Yeah, the Train of Thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

1104
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,378
Oh, we can't wait that long.

1105
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:56,391
- How about we wake her up?
- Sadness, that's ridiculous!

1106
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:58,302
How could we possibly...

1107
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,111
How about we wake her up?

1108
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,295
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

1109
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,631
Whoa! This place is huge!

1110
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:13,431
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

1111
00:52:13,471 --> 00:52:15,271
Wow! I Can Fly?

1112
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:17,296
I love that one!

1113
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:20,779
Rainbow Unicorn!
She's right there!

1114
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:25,591
My friend says you're famous.

1115
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:26,711
She wants your autograph.

1116
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,431
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay?

1117
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:30,791
Sorry, she's from out of town.

1118
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:32,418
That was so embarrassing, right?

1119
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:35,952
I loved you in
Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7.

1120
00:52:35,992 --> 00:52:37,294
Okay, bye. I love you!

1121
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,632
Huh. Wonder what that means.

1122
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:42,213
Oh, well, let's go in.

1123
00:52:44,192 --> 00:52:45,912
Set up the classroom set!

1124
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:47,112
Today's memories are in!

1125
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:48,952
We've got
a lot to work with here.

1126
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:50,392
Riley dumped her best friend,

1127
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:51,952
had a miserable day at school,

1128
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:53,072
and quit hockey.

1129
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:55,592
The writers have
put together a killer script!

1130
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:57,432
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

1131
00:52:57,472 --> 00:52:59,263
I have to do stupid Dream Duty.

1132
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,792
Okay. How are we going to wake her up?

1133
00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:05,752
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

1134
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,472
- We could scare her.
- Scare her?

1135
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:09,272
No, she's been through enough already.

1136
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:10,832
- But, Joy...
- Sadness, you may know your way

1137
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:12,792
around down here, but I know Riley.

1138
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:14,112
We're gonna make her so happy,

1139
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:16,352
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

1140
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:17,753
We'll excite her awake!

1141
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,633
That's never happened before.

1142
00:53:19,673 --> 00:53:21,633
Ooh!
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

1143
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:22,833
I don't think that'll work.

1144
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:24,374
- Bing Bong?
- Yeah?

1145
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:26,833
Don't let anything happen to these.

1146
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:28,193
Got it.

1147
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:31,185
Mmm-hmm. Add the reality
distortion filter.

1148
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:35,833
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

1149
00:53:35,873 --> 00:53:37,273
Riley is the camera!

1150
00:53:37,313 --> 00:53:39,553
Makeup,
get out of there, we are on in five,

1151
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:41,180
four, three...

1152
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,940
Hello, class.

1153
00:53:45,393 --> 00:53:48,673
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

1154
00:53:48,713 --> 00:53:50,513
Man, she is one bad actress.

1155
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:52,583
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

1156
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:57,424
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

1157
00:53:57,753 --> 00:53:59,313
Would you like to stand up

1158
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:01,019
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

1159
00:54:02,554 --> 00:54:04,474
And cue Riley.

1160
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:06,114
My name is Riley Andersen.

1161
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:09,299
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

1162
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:11,819
Ew, look! Her teeth are falling out!

1163
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:14,634
- That's disgusting.
- Ew, gross!

1164
00:54:14,674 --> 00:54:15,874
Teeth falling out.

1165
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:17,501
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

1166
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,194
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

1167
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:22,554
Hey, look!
She came to school with no pants on!

1168
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,754
- Called it!
- Ready?

1169
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,834
I don't think
this happy thing is going to work.

1170
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:27,994
But if we scare her...

1171
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,825
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

1172
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:33,224
Bark! Bark! Bark!

1173
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:36,062
- Who is that?
- Uh, what's going on?

1174
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:43,900
Psst! You're on! Go!

1175
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,235
Whoo! Let's party!

1176
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:48,155
Let's dance! Whoo!

1177
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:49,577
Hey, a party.

1178
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:51,955
Bark, bark, bark!

1179
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:54,219
Joy, this isn't working.

1180
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:57,023
Huh!

1181
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:01,795
Huh? Sadness, what are you doing?

1182
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,457
Come back here!

1183
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:07,257
It's just a dream,
it's just a dream. It's just a dream.

1184
00:55:08,795 --> 00:55:11,576
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

1185
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,181
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1186
00:55:14,355 --> 00:55:15,555
- ♪ Who's your friend
- Bing Bong?

1187
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:16,915
♪ Who likes to play?

1188
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:18,635
Sadness, stop! It was working!

1189
00:55:18,675 --> 00:55:19,977
Ow.

1190
00:55:20,395 --> 00:55:22,675
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1191
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:24,017
But look, it's working!

1192
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,115
Whoa.

1193
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,186
They are not
part of this dream. Get them!

1194
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,621
- Stop right there!
- Ow!

1195
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,144
Pan away! Pan away!

1196
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:39,356
Boo! Pick a plotline!

1197
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:41,236
- Ow! Careful!
- Hold still!

1198
00:55:41,276 --> 00:55:42,556
You can't do this!

1199
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:44,740
I know people in Headquarters!

1200
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:50,027
Ow! Cut that out!
Ow! Please!

1201
00:55:50,356 --> 00:55:51,956
Do you like candy? You look hungry.

1202
00:55:51,996 --> 00:55:54,076
I get you candy! Oh no!

1203
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:55,916
No, no. No, no!

1204
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:57,956
There go the Core Memories!

1205
00:55:57,996 --> 00:55:59,876
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark!

1206
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:01,236
Please!

1207
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:02,658
Oh, come on.

1208
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:05,756
What is this place?

1209
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,036
The Subconscious.

1210
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:09,379
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1211
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:15,357
My hat feels loose.

1212
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:16,677
Mmm. How do we get in?

1213
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:17,837
Let me see.

1214
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,938
You got my hat?
Or is that your hat?

1215
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:21,157
Yeah, it's my hat.

1216
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:23,277
You sure? I don't know,
look in the label.

1217
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,597
- Yeah, it says, "My hat."
- Wait, it says, "My hat"?

1218
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:27,477
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1219
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,837
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1220
00:56:28,877 --> 00:56:30,837
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1221
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:33,260
- Hey! You!
- Oh! You caught us!

1222
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,437
Get back in there!

1223
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:37,268
No escaping!

1224
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,437
I don't like it here.

1225
00:56:47,477 --> 00:56:49,667
It's where they keep
Riley's darkest fears.

1226
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:54,503
It's broccoli.

1227
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,739
The stairs to the basement!

1228
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:02,864
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1229
00:57:11,238 --> 00:57:12,745
Okay, come on.

1230
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,398
Would you walk quieter?

1231
00:57:15,438 --> 00:57:16,740
I'm trying.

1232
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:18,219
What is going...

1233
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:22,421
Candy wrappers?

1234
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,398
- Bing Bong!
- Joy?

1235
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:36,741
- There you are.
- Shhh!

1236
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:44,111
It's Jangles.

1237
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:46,460
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1238
00:57:58,279 --> 00:57:59,679
Do you have the Core Memories?

1239
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,119
Yeah.

1240
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:03,462
All he cared about was the candy!

1241
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:05,707
Shh.

1242
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,542
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

1243
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,160
Wait! The train's not running.

1244
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,000
We still have to wake up Riley.

1245
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,422
But how?

1246
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,667
Oh, no!

1247
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,480
Hey, Sadness.

1248
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,920
Did you hear
about the pa-pa-party they were having?

1249
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,760
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, Joy.

1250
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,600
Isn't it a birthday party?

1251
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,840
Did you say

1252
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,680
birthday?

1253
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,681
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1254
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:06,961
And games and balloons...

1255
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,641
A birthday?

1256
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:10,472
Okay. Follow us!

1257
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:14,441
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1258
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:15,841
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1259
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,441
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1260
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,142
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1261
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:40,389
Who's the birthday girl?

1262
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:46,712
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, let's go!

1263
00:59:53,242 --> 00:59:55,591
Ha-ha! We made it!

1264
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:58,551
Guess who's on their way
to Headquarters!

1265
00:59:58,602 --> 00:59:59,904
We are!

59:59.962 --> 01:00:01.753
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

1266
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:09,242
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1267
01:00:09,282 --> 01:00:11,722
We were at school, and we were
naked, and there was a dog,

1268
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:15,122
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw Bing Bong!

1269
01:00:15,162 --> 01:00:17,282
You idiot! It was a dream!

1270
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,562
This is ridiculous!

1271
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:20,746
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1272
01:00:21,362 --> 01:00:22,903
Time to take action.

1273
01:00:23,482 --> 01:00:25,402
Stupid Mom and Dad.
If they hadn't moved us,

1274
01:00:25,442 --> 01:00:27,074
none of this would've happened.

1275
01:00:27,282 --> 01:00:28,630
Who's with me?

1276
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:30,388
Um...

1277
01:00:30,482 --> 01:00:31,909
No no no no no.

1278
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,795
Yeah. Let's do it.

1279
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,513
She took it. There's no turning back.

1280
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,163
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1281
01:00:51,203 --> 01:00:52,283
Well, why don't we go down

1282
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:54,283
to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?

1283
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:55,723
Hey. That sounds nice.

1284
01:00:55,763 --> 01:00:57,475
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1285
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:01,323
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1286
01:01:01,363 --> 01:01:03,712
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1287
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,843
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1288
01:01:05,883 --> 01:01:08,949
Oh, but I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1289
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:11,563
- ♪ TripleDent gum ♪
- No!

1290
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:13,963
It's downstairs somewhere.

1291
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,684
Mom and Dad got us into this mess.

1292
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:17,470
They can pay to get us out.

1293
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:22,324
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?

1294
01:01:22,364 --> 01:01:24,364
You can see everything from up here.

1295
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:26,484
Look, there's Inductive Reasoning.

1296
01:01:26,524 --> 01:01:27,644
There's Déjà Vu.

1297
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,284
There's Language Processing.

1298
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:30,564
There's Déjà Vu.

1299
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,804
There's Critical Thinking.

1300
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:33,385
There's Déjà Vu.

1301
01:01:33,444 --> 01:01:35,190
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1302
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:38,793
Hey. That was a good idea.

1303
01:01:39,004 --> 01:01:41,114
About scaring Riley awake.

1304
01:01:41,204 --> 01:01:42,586
You're not so bad.

1305
01:01:42,684 --> 01:01:43,986
Really?

1306
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,666
Nice work.

1307
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:49,004
Oh, I can't wait
to get the old Riley back.

1308
01:01:49,044 --> 01:01:50,124
As soon as we get there,

1309
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,830
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1310
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:53,506
Whoa. Is this Riley?

1311
01:01:53,724 --> 01:01:56,164
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1312
01:01:56,204 --> 01:01:57,604
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1313
01:01:57,644 --> 01:02:00,517
Oh, it's that time
in the twisty tree, remember?

1314
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:02,165
The hockey team showed up

1315
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:04,508
and Mom and Dad were there cheering.

1316
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:07,267
Look at her,
having fun and laughing.

1317
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,485
Oh, I love this one.

1318
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,874
Hmm. I love that one, too.

1319
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,205
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1320
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:16,605
Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs

1321
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,445
lost the big playoff game.

1322
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,245
Riley missed the winning shot.

1323
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:22,714
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1324
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:27,152
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1325
01:02:27,925 --> 01:02:31,389
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1326
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:33,273
Okay.

1327
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,626
But I just don't understand.

1328
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:41,388
Why did our moving van
even go to Texas?

1329
01:02:46,046 --> 01:02:47,587
Multiple customers?

1330
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:57,034
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1331
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:02,068
Uh-huh.

1332
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:10,431
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

1333
01:03:15,486 --> 01:03:16,948
Honesty Island?

1334
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:26,269
Look out!

1335
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,029
Come on!

1336
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:39,472
Hold on!

1337
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,367
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!

1338
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:43,472
Come on, people!
Let's, go, go, go!

1339
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:56,954
That was our way home.

1340
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:59,847
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1341
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:02,873
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1342
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,629
What?

1343
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:07,832
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1344
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:09,949
Are we really doing this?

1345
01:04:10,008 --> 01:04:11,608
- I mean, this is serious.
- Look.

1346
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:12,888
We have no Core Memories.

1347
01:04:12,928 --> 01:04:14,408
You want Riley to be happy?

1348
01:04:14,448 --> 01:04:16,831
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1349
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,949
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1350
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:24,074
Family Island. Let's go!

1351
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:40,528
Joy! Joy!

1352
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:41,728
It's too dangerous!

1353
01:04:41,768 --> 01:04:43,989
We won't make it in time.

1354
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:48,520
But that's our only way back!

1355
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:02,476
A recall tube!

1356
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:06,680
We can get recalled!

1357
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:12,039
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1358
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,049
See you after school, monkey.

1359
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:15,437
We love you!

1360
01:05:19,689 --> 01:05:21,151
Go! Run, run! Go!

1361
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:34,435
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1362
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,570
You're hurting Riley!

1363
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,754
Oh, no, no, no! I did it again!

1364
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,130
If you get in here,

1365
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,633
these Core Memories will get sad.

1366
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:51,410
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1367
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:52,912
Joy?

1368
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,636
Joy!

1369
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,112
Joy!

1370
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:47,759
Joy?

1371
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:55,833
Joy!

1372
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,715
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1373
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:12,477
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1374
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:14,514
We're forgotten.

1375
01:07:22,532 --> 01:07:25,234
We used to play tag and stuff.

1376
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,481
But everything's different now.

1377
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:35,239
Since we moved.

1378
01:08:06,173 --> 01:08:09,053
Do you remember how she used to

1379
01:08:09,093 --> 01:08:11,874
stick her tongue out
when she was coloring?

1380
01:08:21,372 --> 01:08:24,803
I could listen to her stories all day.

1381
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,121
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1382
01:08:44,094 --> 01:08:45,680
And now...

1383
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:43,935
It was the day
the Prairie Dogs

1384
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,005
lost the big playoff game.

1385
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,845
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1386
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:52,167
She wanted to quit.

1387
01:10:10,056 --> 01:10:11,404
Sadness.

1388
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:16,126
Mom and Dad... The team...

1389
01:10:17,016 --> 01:10:21,038
They came to help because of Sadness.

1390
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:28,688
We have to get back up there.

1391
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:31,686
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1392
01:10:32,656 --> 01:10:34,925
We might as well be on another planet.

1393
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:42,124
Another planet.

1394
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:47,400
♪ Who's your friend who likes to play?

1395
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:53,605

01:10:54,097 --> 01:10:57,208

Wait, is that someone
walking towards us?

1447
01:13:58,141 --> 01:13:59,603
Yep, let's cross the street.

1448
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,661
It's Mom. She's onto us!

1449
01:14:05,701 --> 01:14:06,861
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1450
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,581
Riley needs to get Core Memories.

1451
01:14:08,621 --> 01:14:10,606
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1452
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:14,803
Sadness!

1453
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:27,207
Sadness! Sadness?

1454
01:14:27,582 --> 01:14:30,422
Come on, Sadness.
Where are you? Okay.

1455
01:14:30,462 --> 01:14:32,731
If I were Sadness, where would I be?

1456
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:37,902
Oh. Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1457
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:41,486
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1458
01:14:57,222 --> 01:14:59,207
Oh, no! It's Mom again! What do we do?

1459
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:07,983
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1460
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:10,326
Let's get this idea
out of her head.

1461
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,805
Sadness?

1462
01:15:11,943 --> 01:15:14,167
Sadness!

1463
01:15:14,863 --> 01:15:16,165
Joy?

1464
01:15:16,703 --> 01:15:18,369
Wait! Sadness!

1465
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:22,503
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1466
01:15:22,543 --> 01:15:23,844
Come back!

1467
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:30,463
Okay, you're saying your husband

1468
01:15:30,503 --> 01:15:32,343
was blown away by an elephant.

1469
01:15:32,383 --> 01:15:33,503
Was he with anyone?

1470
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:35,023
Yes! And there she is!

1471
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,423
Hey! Come back here!

1472
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:38,892
Forget it, Jake. It's Cloud Town.

1473
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:44,144
Oh! What? Sadness!

1474
01:15:44,184 --> 01:15:47,184
I only make
everything worse!

1475
01:15:47,224 --> 01:15:49,687
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1476
01:15:59,704 --> 01:16:01,384
- It's stuck!
- Oh, great.

1477
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:03,384
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1478
01:16:03,424 --> 01:16:05,727
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1479
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:15,984
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1480
01:16:16,024 --> 01:16:18,024
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1481
01:16:18,064 --> 01:16:19,904
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1482
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:22,064
Ah! Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1483
01:16:22,104 --> 01:16:23,384
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1484
01:16:23,424 --> 01:16:24,544
No, I didn't! Don't touch that!

1485
01:16:24,584 --> 01:16:26,806
Let me do it! Get out of here!

1486
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,976
Guys, we can't make Riley feel anything.

1487
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:36,091
What have we done?

1488
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:38,225
Hey! Hey, look at me!

1489
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,745
Did you mean what you said before?

1490
01:16:39,785 --> 01:16:42,105
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1491
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,130
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1492
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,585
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1493
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,406
I would die for Riley!

1494
01:17:08,025 --> 01:17:09,931
That's it! I fold!

1495
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:28,426
Whoa!

1496
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:30,576
Whoa.

1497
01:17:31,706 --> 01:17:32,786
Whoa!

1498
01:17:32,826 --> 01:17:34,652
Whoa!

1499
01:17:40,586 --> 01:17:44,812
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1500
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:50,176
I am positive this is crazy!

1501
01:17:54,427 --> 01:17:57,334
- Now!
- For Riley!

1502
01:18:04,867 --> 01:18:06,772
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1503
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:10,296
Oh, I wish Joy was here!

1504
01:18:17,227 --> 01:18:18,689
It's Joy!

1505
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:20,694
Stand back!

1506
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:22,707
That worked.

1507
01:18:22,747 --> 01:18:25,210
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1508
01:18:25,387 --> 01:18:28,107
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1509
01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:30,987
- What?
- Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1510
01:18:31,027 --> 01:18:33,808
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1511
01:18:33,947 --> 01:18:35,987
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you,

1512
01:18:36,027 --> 01:18:38,297
but let me try. Duh!

1513
01:18:47,788 --> 01:18:49,148
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

1514
01:18:49,188 --> 01:18:51,188
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1515
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,497
We were just trying to
make happy memories.

1516
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,508
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1517
01:19:04,548 --> 01:19:06,268
Sadness, it's up to you.

1518
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,498
- Me?
- Sadness?

1519
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:09,868
I can't, Joy.

1520
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:12,815
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1521
01:19:24,589 --> 01:19:26,016
Okay.

1522
01:19:46,269 --> 01:19:49,176
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1523
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,349
All right. Thank you. We will.

1524
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:04,750
Her teacher hasn't even
seen Riley all day.

1525
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:05,950
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

1526
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:08,150
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

1527
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,430
Riley, there you are!
Thank goodness!

1528
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,630
We were worried sick!

1529
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,150
Where have you been? It's so late!

1530
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:14,310
Oh, honey!
What happened? Are you all right?

1531
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,390
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1532
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:18,062
we talked to your teacher.

1533
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:47,976
I know you don't want me to but...

1534
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:50,504
I miss home.

1535
01:21:52,192 --> 01:21:54,063
I miss Minnesota.

1536
01:21:57,192 --> 01:22:00,622
You need me to be happy, but...

1537
01:22:02,232 --> 01:22:06,982
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1538
01:22:09,112 --> 01:22:10,903
I want to go home.

1539
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:14,384
Please don't be mad.

1540
01:22:17,153 --> 01:22:18,673
Oh, sweetie.

1541
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:20,300
We're not mad.

1542
01:22:21,753 --> 01:22:25,501
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1543
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,940
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1544
01:22:30,353 --> 01:22:33,100
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1545
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,824
Spring Lake,
where you learned to skate.

1546
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:40,095
Come here.

1547
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:02,995
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1548
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:04,515
Friendship Island has expanded.

1549
01:24:04,555 --> 01:24:07,155
Glad they finally opened
that Friendly Argument section.

1550
01:24:07,195 --> 01:24:09,355
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1551
01:24:09,395 --> 01:24:12,075
Fashion Island? Oh. Everyone shut up.

1552
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:14,355
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1553
01:24:14,395 --> 01:24:17,586
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1554
01:24:18,515 --> 01:24:19,795
All right. Here you go.

1555
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:22,715
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1556
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:24,236
- Ooh!
- Wow!

1557
01:24:24,276 --> 01:24:25,676
- Cool! Upgrade!
- Ooh!

1558
01:24:25,716 --> 01:24:26,876
Hey! Whoa-ho!

1559
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,537
Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1560
01:24:29,476 --> 01:24:30,676
Hey. guys? What's pub-er-ty?

1561
01:24:30,716 --> 01:24:32,756
I don't know. It's probably not important.

1562
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:36,876
Whoa. I have access to
the entire curse word library!

1563
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,742
This new console is the...

1564
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:41,756
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1565
01:24:41,796 --> 01:24:43,217
They're getting to the rink.

1566
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:46,436
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1567
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:48,276
- I know, Dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1568
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,996
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1569
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:52,956
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!

1570
01:24:52,996 --> 01:24:54,076
Go Foghorns!

1571
01:24:54,116 --> 01:24:56,076
Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!

1572
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:58,226
Okay! I got to go!

1573
01:24:58,676 --> 01:24:59,956
- Aw!
- They love us.

1574
01:24:59,996 --> 01:25:01,676
Yeah, Mom and Dad are pretty cool.

1575
01:25:01,716 --> 01:25:04,463
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1576
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:07,917
She loved the face painting!

1577
01:25:07,957 --> 01:25:09,783
Ha! Told you it was a great idea!

1578
01:25:10,517 --> 01:25:12,277
Best idea he's had in a while.

1579
01:25:12,317 --> 01:25:14,108
He's a really good guy.

1580
01:25:18,477 --> 01:25:19,939
Just in case.

1581
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:22,259
Oh!

1582
01:25:23,557 --> 01:25:24,859
Sorry.

1583
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:31,425
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1584
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:35,822
Uh... Okay. Bye.

1585
01:25:37,397 --> 01:25:40,197
Remember, just hustle.

1586
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:41,869
Go, Riley!

1587
01:25:42,357 --> 01:25:43,898
You got this!

1588
01:25:45,517 --> 01:25:47,317
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1589
01:25:47,357 --> 01:25:49,797
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1590
01:25:49,837 --> 01:25:51,958
All right, Anger, take it!

1591
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:53,238
Give us that puck
or you're dead meat!

1592
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:54,318
On our left. On our left!

1593
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,998
Let's just try not
to get all smelly this time.

1594
01:25:56,038 --> 01:25:58,478
Oh. Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

1595
01:25:58,518 --> 01:25:59,900
Not for long!

1596
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:03,318
We've been through
a lot lately, that's for sure.

1597
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,158
But we still love our girl.

1598
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:08,038
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1599
01:26:08,078 --> 01:26:09,665
Things couldn't be better.

1600
01:26:09,718 --> 01:26:13,819
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1601
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,759
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1602
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:39,959
Anyone? Jordan?

1603
01:26:39,999 --> 01:26:42,029
Uh...

1604
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:43,719
How much more of this?

1605
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:45,879
Five months, two weeks and four days

1606
01:26:45,919 --> 01:26:47,519
until summer vacation.

1607
01:26:47,559 --> 01:26:50,943
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1608
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:54,191
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1609
01:26:57,919 --> 01:26:59,710
Have a nice day.

1610
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:01,719
What are we mad about?

1611
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:03,879
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1612
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,199
What's Troy mad about?

1613
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:06,826
I don't know.

1614
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,865
I know. Totally.

1615
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:10,839
We're a total fraud!

1616
01:27:10,879 --> 01:27:12,239
Do you think they can see through us?

1617
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:14,239
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1618
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:16,309
Being cool is so exhausting.

1619
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:22,505
Who's the birthday girl?
Huh? Hey! Hello?

1620
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,480
Six years of drama school for this?

1621
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,947
Move it, will you?

1622
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,520
What are you doing? Come on!

1623
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,400
You know what?
This is okay. This is fine.

1624
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,600
We just need to go to our happy place.
